        Welcome! My name is Krystal Joyce, and I’m excited to share my professional journey with you.

      <h3>Professional Background</h3>
      <p>
        I hold a BSE in Elementary Education and have over 10 years of experience teaching across multiple
        grade levels. I later transitioned into nonprofit counseling, working with adolescents facing
        substance-use challenges and eventually serving as a supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri,
        where I’m building skills in instructional design, technology integration, and creating accessible
        learning experiences.
