        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>
            I hold a BSE in Elementary Education and have over 10 years of teaching experience. I later
            transitioned into nonprofit counseling, working with adolescents facing substance-use challenges
            and serving as a supervisor. Currently, I work as a Level 1 Support Technician for SightView Software
            while pursuing a Master’s in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri.
