    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Hi, I’m Krystal Joyce, and welcome to my professional portfolio. Here, you’ll find examples of my instructional design projects, graduate coursework, and technology-based training resources. My site highlights how I combine teaching, counseling, and technology experience to create learning solutions that are clear, accessible, and learner-centered.</p>

    <p>This portfolio represents both my academic growth and my professional skills. My purpose is to share the work I’ve created, reflect on what I’ve learned, and demonstrate my ability to design engaging, user-focused instructional materials. Whether you are a professor, a peer, or a potential employer, I hope this portfolio gives you insight into my dedication to learning technologies and design.</p>
